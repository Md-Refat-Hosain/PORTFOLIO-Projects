# Used Car Price Prediction

This is a comprehensive, end-to-end data science project demonstrating the full lifecycle of building a machine learning model for used car price prediction, from handling messy raw data to robust model development.

## üéØ Overview & Goal

* This project represents a complete end-to-end data science endeavor, tackling the complexities of feature extraction from highly unstructured text data. It encompasses robust data preprocessing, in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), rigorous model building, advanced hyperparameter tuning, and the final selection of the optimal predictive model. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.

* My primary objectives for this project were two-fold:
    1.  To uncover and extract non-obvious, actionable insights from this challenging dataset that could provide novel value to stakeholders and inform strategic decisions.
    2.  To develop a highly accurate and reliable prediction model that can empower new entrants in the used car market by providing clear market price estimations, thereby fostering confidence and informed decision-making.

### 1. Data Processing & Feature Engineering

* **Source Data:** The project utilized a comprehensive dataset of car listings, including attributes such as mileage, horsepower, age, transmission details, and various categorical features.


### Data Cleaning:

* Handled missing values through appropriate imputation strategies (e.g., median for numerical features, mode for categorical features).

* Identified and addressed outliers in numerical features (e.g., price, mileage, horsepower) to improve model robustness.

### Feature Engineering:

* Created new features where applicable (e.g., Age from year of manufacture, if not directly available).

* Managed complex categorical features, including those with special characters like 'Plug-In Hybrid' and '‚Äì', ensuring they were correctly processed for model training.

### Data Transformation:

* Applied log transformation to the target variable (car price) to mitigate skewness and stabilize variance, which significantly improved model performance.

* Used One-Hot Encoding for nominal categorical features and potentially Target Encoding / Label Encoding for high-cardinality features to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

* Standardization/Normalization was applied to numerical features to scale them consistently.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Aspects: Model Development & Evaluation

### Model Development & Evaluation

* **Model Selection:** Explored a range of regression models to identify the best performer for the car price prediction task:
    * **Linear Regression:** Established a baseline understanding of linear relationships.
    * **Random Forest Regressor:** Leveraged ensemble learning for robust predictions and feature importance insights.
    * **XGBoost Regressor (Extreme Gradient Boosting):** Employed a highly optimized gradient boosting framework known for its performance on tabular data.

### Hyperparameter Tuning:

* Utilized GridSearchCV with K-Fold Cross-Validation to systematically search for the optimal hyperparameters for the best-performing model, ensuring robust generalization and preventing overfitting.

### Best Performing Model:

* The Hyperparameter Tuned XGBoost Regressor emerged as the top performer, demonstrating superior predictive accuracy compared to other models.

### Evaluation Metrics: Model performance was rigorously assessed using:

* **R-squared ($R^2$):**
    * Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables. Achieved an $R^2$ of **0.8072 (on log-transformed prices)** with the best XGBoost model.

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Represents the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. Achieved an MAE of **\$17,641.91 (on original price scale)**.

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** A measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. The RMSE of **\$154,451.56 (on original price scale)** indicated the presence of a few very large errors, primarily on high-value outlier cars, which was further investigated through residual analysis.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements & Learnings

### Residual Analysis:

* A detailed residual analysis was performed to understand the nature of prediction errors, particularly the large discrepancies observed for high-value cars. This identified a need for more nuanced handling of outliers or rare, expensive vehicle types.

### Potential Improvements:

* Further investigation into the features of high-error data points to identify unique characteristics or data quality issues.

* Exploring advanced feature engineering specific to luxury/exotic car segments.

* Consider a specialized sub-model or different modeling approach for very high-value vehicles if sufficient data for that segment is available.

* Implementing model monitoring (data drift, concept drift) post-deployment.

* Exploring model interpretability techniques (SHAP/LIME) for deeper insights.
